## Setup

### Installing pre-req software for the course

#### Instructions for Installation and setting up of your development environments:

##### Installing Python :

Install Python 3.6.5(32 Bit) on your machines. If you have any older versions please uninstall and install this particular version of python.

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe

##### Installing and Configuring PyCharm Community Edition (IDE) :

Download the Pycharm Community Edition from the following link :

> https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2017.2.4.exe

Note: Please download the file from the link we provided above (PyCharm 2017 Version),

Make sure you select shortcut (32-bit or 64-bit) based on your processor/OS type (i.e, Select 32-bit Launcher Shortcut if you have a 32-bit Processor/OS or else select 64-bit Launcher)

We recommend that you watch this video once in full and then try to start your installation on your second viewing:

**The above installation video shows you how to**:
* How to install pycharm community edition
* How to create and configure your "pythoncourse" project
* How to install dependency packages - pytest
* How to configure a shortcut for your python console.
* How to configure the comments color. Download this file for this step: [ppcourse.icls](./ppcourse.icls)

Changing the default coloring scheme of pycharm

The default coloring scheme in pycharm (for comments, docstrings and strings) makes it easy to skip over the lesson notes and helpful comments/hints and we see questions that will not come up if you read the notes carefully. So be sure to do step 5 above.

##### Installation Issues

For any issues during installation, please post a clear description of your problem with screenshots (taken using Jing! and annotated appropriately) on the forum and try to help each other resolve these issues.
